\section*{Problem 1 }
\section*{a}  
Report how many iterations it takes to converge as well as the names of the 5 members of congress with the highest pagerank scores in order, along with their pagerank scores. \\
Converging after iteration:7 \\
Chuck Grassley: 0.0038714829239431974 \\
John Cornyn: 0.003987288917133025 \\
Nancy Pelosi: 0.004377348362167116 \\
Steve Scalise: 0.004435625118816466 \\
Kevin McCarthy: 0.005984807685924966 \\

\section*{b} 
Report the 5 members of congress with the highest pagerank scores afterjust one iteration, again in order and with their scores. You should notice some differences from the converged results.How would you explain those differences? \\
James E. Clyburn: 0.0037413721012512003
Steny H. Hoyer: 0.0038926532119787824
Nancy Pelosi: 0.004593239283159686
Steve Scalise: 0.005038725421810373
Kevin McCarthy: 0.006847308900622567

After just 1 iteration, there is a lot more variability in the potential results . 

\section*{Problem 2}

\section*{a} 
Explain how to do thisand implement the optimization in your code.

\section*{b} 
Report the titles5of the five articleswith the highest overall pagerank scores, along with their scores.

 
\section*{c} 
Report your results for thequery “neutrino”.
